This program follows all rules set forth by the assignment PDF. It builds off the
posted solution for assignment 1.07. The to main functions are parse_item_descriptions
and parse_item_description.

**** I made the assumption that the monster description save file will be present ***

/*
 * Function: parse_item_description
 * ----------------------------------
 * main workhorse function that parses each individual item description
 */

 /*
 * Function: parse_item_descriptions
 * ----------------------------------
 * function that handles checking the object file semantic and loops through
 * parse_item_description for each object
 */
